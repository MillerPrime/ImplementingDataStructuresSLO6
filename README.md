# Implementing Data Structures - SLO #6

## What it does
This program uses a **LinkedList** to store apartment objects.  
Each apartment has:
- Street address
- Apartment number
- Monthly rent
- Number of bedrooms  

The user enters apartment details through the console.  
When finished, the program sorts all apartments by monthly rent (lowest to highest) and displays them.

## How to run it
1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Compile both files: `Apartment.java` and `ApartmentsLinkedList.java`.
3. Run `ApartmentsLinkedList.java`.
4. Enter apartment details when prompted.  
   - Type `-1` for the street address to stop entering apartments.
5. The program will print the sorted list of apartments by rent in the console.
